# People
This is a list of people who know about OpenAPI.

## Level One
People directly associated with the OpenAPI conversation (for example, those developing, maintaining or evangelizing the OpenAPI specification or tool/products).


## Level Two
People in the community actively talking about OpenAPI (for example, people using OAS for their work where that work is not the OAS itself - the consumers).


## Level Three
People who've mentioned what they are doing, but not much more.
